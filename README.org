#+TITLE: password-store-ivy

A [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] frontend based on [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#ivy][Ivy]], made primarily to use with [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] and [[https://github.com/tumashu/ivy-posframe][ivy-posframe]]. Types fields from entries.

Also take a look at Nicolas Petton's [[https://github.com/NicolasPetton/pass][pass]], =password-store-ivy= is designed as complementary to the Nicolas' package.

This package is made with Ivy because I need some fine-tuning like actions and turning off sorting in some completions, and Ivy happens to be the completion system I'm using now.

* Installation
As the package isnâ€™t yet available anywhere but in this repository, you can clone the repository, add it to the load-path and require the package. My preferred way is =use-package= with =straight=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package password-store-ivy
  :straight (:host github :repo "SqrtMinusOne/password-store-ivy")
  :after (exwm))
#+end_src

This package types stuff with =xdotool=, so you need to have that available in your =$PATH=.
* Usage
Emacs' built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/auth/The-Unix-password-store.html][password store]] integration has to be set up.

The only command is =M-x password-store-ivy=, which invokes Ivy to select an entry from the pass database. Available commands in the selection buffer:
- =M-a=. Perform autotype
- =M-p=. Type password
- =M-u=. Type username
- =M-U=. Type url
- =M-f=. Select a field to type

* Customization
There are a few parameters that control delays:
- =password-store-ivy-initial-wait= controls the initial delay before starting to type a sequence (in milliseconds)
- =password-store-ivy-delay= controls the delay between typing characters (in milliseconds)

There is also =password-store-ivy-sequences= that determines the sequence of actions =password-store-ivy= performs.

It is an alist with the following required keys (corresponding to the basic actions):
- =autotype=
- =password=
- =username=
- =url=

The values are lists of the following elements:
- =wait=.  Wait for =password-store-ivy-initial-wait= milliseconds
- =(wait <milliseconds>)=.  Wait for =<milliseconds>=.
- =(key <key>)=.  Type =<key>=.
- =(field <field>)=.  Type =<field>= of entry.

For example, the starting values:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
'((autotype . (wait
               (field . "username")
               (key . "Tab")
               (field . secret)
               (key . "Return")))
  (password . (wait (field . secret)))
  (username . (wait (field . "username")))
  (url . (wait (field . "url"))))
#+end_src

In addition to the global override, sequences can be overriden per-entry with a field called =sequence-<name>=, where =<name>= is a key of =password-store-ivy-sequences=.

For example, here is an override to press =Tab= twice:
#+begin_example
<pass>
username: thexcloud@gmail.com
url: <url>
sequence-autotype: (wait (field . "username") (key . "Tab") (key . "Tab") (field . secret) (key . "Return"))
#+end_example
